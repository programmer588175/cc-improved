# NOTE
This is not the new 2.018 version, this is v2.016
# Versions
0.1: Added (March 4, 2019)

0.1.1: Lucky digit/number/payout fix, prestige levels must be divisible by the value instead of ending in it. (I did this so that you can get the upgrade past 9 quadrillion. Numbers cannot end in 7 past 9 quadrillion due to floating point) (March 5, 2019)
# To Do
