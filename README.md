# NOTE

# Changelog
0.1: Added (March 4, 2019)

0.1.1: Lucky digit/number/payout fix, prestige levels must be divisible by the value instead of ending in it. (I did this so that you can get the upgrade past 9 quadrillion. Numbers cannot end in 7 past 9 quadrillion, because all of the numbers will be even and not end in 7) (March 5, 2019)

0.1.2: Added a function where if the number returns scientific notation, there won't be commas after the decimal point (it rounds to 17 significant digits) (April 2, 2019)
