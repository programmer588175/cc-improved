An improved version of Cookie Clicker v2.016 beta. Credit to Orteil for the original Cookie Clicker. Use the website or extract to play!
# NOTE
This is not the new 2.018 beta, this is v2.016
# Versions
0.1: added, with fixed number function (shows "exact" values) (March 4, 2019)

0.1.1: Lucky digit/number/payout fix, levels must be divisible by the value (I did this so that you can get the upgrade past 9 quadrillion) (March 5, 2019)
# To Do
Fix the page not loading. WHY IS THIS UNPLAYABLE 90% OF THE TIME?

Fix short numbers not working.

Fix the "fixednum" function not working, scientific notation is still there (I have a file with 13 Sextillion cookies and it still shows 1.3e+22)
